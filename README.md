# Bayes-Rule-with-Forecasting
Using R to implement Bayes Rule with Forecasting.

## Overview
The following document will use R to implement the Bayes Rule with Forecasting on a given Situation

## Situation
Let's assume that Madison, Wisconsin gets about 115 days of precipitation per year. Suppose that when there is precipitation, the forecast on Channel 3000 is correct 93% of the time and when there is no precipitation in the city, they are correct 87% of the time.

## Question: How many days will Channel 3000 correctly forecast in a non-leap year (365 days)

### Answer
$Correct Forecast = (Odds Correct for Precipitation) * (Days there is Precipitation) + (Odds Correct for Non-Precipitation) * (Days there is No Precipitation)
