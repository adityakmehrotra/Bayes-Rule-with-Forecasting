## Overview
-- The following document will use R to implement the Bayes Rule with Forecasting on a given Situation

## Situation
Let's assume that Madison, Wisconsin gets about 115 days of precipitation per year. Suppose that when there is precipitation, the forecast on Channel 3000 is correct 93% of the time and when there is no precipitation in the city, they are correct 87% of the time.
